# Consider TTL-based process cache

darwin.go:34-39 clears cache every collect cycle; consider TTL expiry instead for better performance

## Notes

**2026-01-16T16:55:21Z**

Deferred: current clear-every-cycle approach is correct and simpler. TTL-based cache adds complexity (tracking timestamps, handling stale PIDs) for marginal perf gain. PID reuse is rare but when it happens, TTL could return wrong process name. Keep current approach.
